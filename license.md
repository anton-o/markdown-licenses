Woah, meta.

I'm not sure what the license of the Creative Commons licenses are, or how that even works. The CC says all the content on their [website](https://creativecommons.org) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) unless otherwise noted, so maybe that's it.
