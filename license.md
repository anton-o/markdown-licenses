Wow, meta.

I'm not sure what the license of the Creative Commons licenses are, or how that even works.

On their [website](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), they say all content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) unless otherwise noted, so maybe that's it.

If you're worried, [contact the CC](https://creativecommons.org/contact).
