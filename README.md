# Markdown Licenses

Licenses should be in Markdown, because they're just text, Markdown is cool, and GitHub makes Markdown easy to read. This repository aims to provide a bunch of licenses converted to Markdown.

Also, more public Git repositories should include a license file, because it's the difference between "all rights reserved" and "some rights reserved". So this project also aims to help people choose one.

Pull-requests with more licenses are very welcome.

## I care about sharing improvements.

The **GNU General Public License** (GPL) is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. ([markdown](/gnu-gpl.md), [original](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html))

## I want it simple and permissive.

The **MIT License** is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and don't hold you liable. ([markdown](/mit.md))

## My content isn't code

The **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike** license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

## I don't want a license

You're under no obligation to choose a license and it's your right not to include one with your code or project. But please note that opting out of open source licenses doesn't mean youâ€™re opting out of copyright law.

You'll have to check with your own legal counsel regarding your particular project, but generally speaking, the absence of a license means that default copyright laws apply. This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. This might not be what you intend.

Even in the absence of a license file, if you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, you have accepted the Terms of Service which do allow other GitHub users some rights. Specifically, you allow others to view and fork your repository.

If you want to share your work with others, please consider choosing an open source license.
