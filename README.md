# Markdown Licenses

This was going to be a collection of Creative Commons licenses converted to Markdown, because, amazingly, the CC licenses are *only* provided in HTML. But actually, most licenses aren't in Markdown, even though they should be. Licenses are just text, Markdown is cool, and GitHub makes Markdown easy to read.

So this repository aims to provide a bunch of licenses converted to Markdown.  Pull-requests are very welcome.

Also, more public Git repositories should include a license file, because it's the difference between "all rights reserved" and "some rights reserved.

To help people choose a license, this readme will include text from GitHub's [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/) as each license is converted. The descriptions for the Creative Commons licenses are from the [Creative Commons website](https://creativecommons.org/).

## I care about sharing improvements.

The **GNU General Public License** (GPL) is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. ([markdown](/gnu-gpl.md), [original](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html))

## I want it simple and permissive.

The **MIT License** is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and don't hold you liable. ([markdown](/mit.md))

## I want to put my software in the public domain.

The **Unlicense** dedicates your software to the public domain. Anyone would be able to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means. You won't be held liable. ([markdown](/unlicense.md), [original](http://unlicense.org/))

## My content isn't code.

The [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses are great for creative works that aren't software.

The **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike** license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

## I don't want to license my software.

You're under no obligation to choose a license and it's your right not to include one with your code or project. But please note that opting out of open source licenses doesn't mean youâ€™re opting out of copyright law.

You'll have to check with your own legal counsel regarding your particular project, but generally speaking, the absence of a license means that default copyright laws apply. This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. This might not be what you intend.

Even in the absence of a license file, if you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, you have accepted the Terms of Service which do allow other GitHub users some rights. Specifically, you allow others to view and fork your repository.

If you want to share your work with others, please consider choosing an open source license.
