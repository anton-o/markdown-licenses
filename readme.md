# Creative Commons in markdown

I wanted to license a repository with Creative Commons, but I was amazed to find that the CC legal codes are only available as [webpages](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode); there's no way to acquire the CC licenses without markup.

So I converted the [Attribution-ShareAlike](/attribution-sharealike.md) license to Markdown because that's what I wanted to use. I'll add more as I want them.

Please fork and add more CC licenses - but stick to the same Markdown format as the existing licenses.

## What is this jibberish?

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a tool that lets people work together on files. It's a [distributed version control system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo).

A Git project is called a repository. It contains the files and folders of the project and the record of changes to those files.

A repository should have a license file that specifies what terms the authors provide their work under.

The [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses are free, easy-to-use copyright licenses which provide a simple, standardized way to give the public permission to share and use your creative work — on conditions of your choice. CC licenses let you easily change your copyright terms from the default of "all rights reserved" to "some rights reserved."

There are other licenses like the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) which are better for public software projects. The Creative Commons licenses are great for other creative works, though.

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a plain-text formatting syntax which is easy to write and easy to read. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
