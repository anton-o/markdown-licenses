# Creative Commons licenses in Markdown

I wanted to license a Git repository under Creative Commons, but I was amazed to find that there's no way to acquire the CC licenses in text.

Anyway, I've converted the [Attribution-ShareAlike Unported 3.0](/by-sa-3.0.md) because that's what I wanted to use. I'll add more as I want them.

Please fork and add more CC licenses! Try to keep it in the same markdown format as the existing licenses in this repo.
