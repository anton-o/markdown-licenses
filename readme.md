# Markdown Licenses

Licenses should be in Markdown, because they're just text, Markdown is cool, and GitHub makes Markdown easy to read. This repository aims to provide a bunch of licenses converted to Markdown.

Also, more public Git repositories should include a license file, because it's the difference between "all rights reserved" and "some rights reserved". So, I've copied some text from GitHub's [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/) to help people choose one.

Pull-requests with more licenses are very welcome.

## I care about sharing improvements

The **GNU General Public License** (GPL) is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. ([markdown](/gnu-gpl.md), [original](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html))

## My content isn't code

The **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike** license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.
